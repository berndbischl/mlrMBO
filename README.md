# Introduction

`mlrMBO` is a highly configurable R toolbox for model-based / Bayesian optimization of black-box functions.

Features:

* EGO-type algorithms (Kriging with expected improvement) on purely numerical search spaces, see [Jones et al. (1998)](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1008306431147)
* Mixed search spaces with numerical, integer, categorical and subordinate parameters
* Arbitrary parameter transformation allowing to optimize on, e.g., logscale
* Optimization of noisy objective functions
* Multi-Criteria optimization with approximated Pareto fronts
* Parallelization through multi-point batch proposals
* Parallelization on many parallel back-ends and clusters through [batchtools](https://github.com/mllg/batchtools) and [parallelMap](https://github.com/berndbischl/parallelMap)

For the *surrogate*, `mlrMBO` allows any regression learner from [`mlr`](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr), including:
* Kriging aka. Gaussian processes (i.e. `DiceKriging`)
* random Forests (i.e. `randomForest`)
* and many more...

Various *infill criteria* (aka. _acquisition functions_) are available:
* Expected improvement (EI)
* Upper/Lower confidence bound (LCB, aka. statistical lower or upper bound)
* Augmented expected improvement (AEI)
* Expected quantile improvement (EQI)
* API for custom infill criteria

Objective functions are created with package [smoof](https://github.com/jakobbossek/smoof), which also offers many test functions for example runs or benchmarks.

Parameter spaces and initial designs are created with package [ParamHelpers](https://github.com/berndbischl/ParamHelpers).
