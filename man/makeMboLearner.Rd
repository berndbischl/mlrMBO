\description{
This is a helper function that generates the right learner for the surrogate, based on criteria of the objective function.
For numeric only parameter spaces it returns a Kriging regression learner with the following settings: \cr
If the objective function is noisy the nugget effect will be estimated unless \code{nugget.estim = FALSE} is explicitly given in \code{...}.
Also \code{jitter} is set to \code{TRUE} to circumvent a problem with DiceKriging where already trained input values produce the exact trained output.
For further informations check the \code{$note} slot of the created learner.
If the objective function is deterministic we add a small nugget effect to increase numerical stability which prevents crashes of DiceKriging. 
The nugget effect is set to 10^-8 * Var(y) on each model training.
For mixed parameter spaces the function returns a random forest regression learner.
The method to estimate the variance is the standard deviation of the bagged predictions.
You can override this setting in \code{...}.
