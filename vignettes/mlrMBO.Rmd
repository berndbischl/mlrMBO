This Vignette is supposed to give you a short introductory glance at the key features of `mlrMBO`.
More detailed and in depth tutorials on special topics can be found in the other vignette files on our GitHub project page:

- [Project Page](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlrMBO/)
- Online documentation of [mlrMBO](https://mlr-org.github.io/mlrMBO/)

## Purpose

The main goal of `mlrMBO` is to optimize *Expensive Black-Box Functions* through *Model-Based Optimization* and to provide a unified interface for different MBO flavours and optimization tasks, namely:

- Efficient global optimization of problems with numerical domain and Kriging as surrogate
- Multi-criteria optimization using different strategies
- Allowing arbitary regression models interfacing [mlr](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr/) to be used as a surrogate
- Built-in parallelization using multi point proposals

## Quickstart

**This guide gives an overview of the typical optimization workflow with mlrMBO.**

### Prerequisites

With the installation of `mlrMBO` the dependencies `mlr`, `ParamHelpers`, and `smoof` will be installed and also loaded, when you load `mlr`.
However, for this tutorial you will need the Package `DiceKriging` for the surrogate learner and later `randomForest` for the surrogate model.

```{r load_package}
library(mlrMBO)
```

### General MBO Workflow

The following steps are needed to start the optimization with `mbo()`.

1. Define the **objective function** and its parameters by using the package `smoof`.
2. Generate an **initial design**.
3. Define a learner, i.e., the **surrogate model**.
4. Set up a **MBO control** object.
5. Finally start the optimization.

Step 2 and 3 are optional as `mbo()` has defaults for these.


### Optimizing a one dimensional function.

For a simple example we minimize a cosine mixture function with an initial design of 5 points and 10 further evaluations.
Meaning that in total the optimizer gets 15 evaluations on the objective function to find the optimum.

#### Objective Function

Instead of writing the objective function by hand, we use the [*smoof*](https://cran.r-project.org/package=smoof) package which offers many single objective functions frequently used for benchmarking of optimizers.
[smoof](https://cran.r-project.org/package=smoof) is a dependency and gets automatically attached with mlrMBO.

_Note:_ You are not limited to these test functions but can define arbitrary objective functions with *smoof*.
Check `?smoof::makeSingleObjectiveFunction` for an example.

```{r cosine_fun}
obj.fun = makeCosineMixtureFunction(1)
obj.fun = convertToMinimization(obj.fun)
print(obj.fun)
ggplot2::autoplot(obj.fun)
```

#### Initial Design

Before the MBO algorithm can starts it needs a set of already evaluated points - the *inital design*.
If no design is given (i.e. `design = NULL`) `mbo()` will use a *Maximin Latin Hypercube* `lhs::maximinLHS()` design with `n = 4 * getNumberOfParameters(obj.fun)` points.
If the design does not include function outcomes `mbo()` will evaluate the design first before starting with the MBO algorithm.
In this example we generate our own design.

```{r}
des = generateDesign(n = 5, par.set = getParamSet(obj.fun), fun = lhs::randomLHS)
```

We will also precalculate the results:

```{r}
des$y = apply(des, 1, obj.fun)
```

_Note:_ *mlrMBO* uses `y` as a default name for the outcome of the objective function.
This can be changed in the control object.

#### Surrogate Model

We decide to use Kriging as our surrogate model because it is the most common for numerical model-based optimization and has prooven to be quite effective.
`mbo()` will take any regression learner from **mlr**.

```{r}
surr.km = makeLearner("regr.km", predict.type = "se", covtype = "matern3_2", control = list(trace = FALSE))
```

_Note:_ If no surrogate learner is defined, `mbo()` autmatically uses Kriging for a numerical domain, otherwise *random forest regression*.

#### MBOControl

The `MBOControl` object contains all further settings for `mbo()`.
It is created with `makeMBOControl()`.
For further customization there are the following functions:
* `setMBOControlTermination()`: It is obligatory to define a terination criterion like the number of MBO iterations.
* `setMBOControlInfill()`: It is recomended to set the infill criterion. For learners that support `predict.type = "se"` the Confidence Bound `"cb"` and the Expected Improvement `"ei"` are a good choice.
* `setMBOControlMultiPoint()`: Needed, in case you want to evaluate more then just one point per MBO-Iteration you can control this process here. This makes sense for parallelization.
* `setMBOControlMultiObj()`: Needed, in case you want to optimize a muli objective target function.


```{r cosine_setup}
control = makeMBOControl()
control = setMBOControlTermination(control, iters = 10)
control = setMBOControlInfill(control, crit = makeMBOInfillCritEI())
```

Finally, we start the optimization process and print the result object, which gives us the best found solution and the reached objective value.
These can also be accessed using the '$' operator.

```{r cosine_run}
run = mbo(obj.fun, design = des, learner = surr.km, control = control, show.info = TRUE)
print(run)
```

### Visualization

To get better insight into the MBO process, we can start the previous optimization with the function `exampleRun()` instead of `mbo()`.
This specialized function augments the results of `mbo()` with additional information for plotting.
Here, we plot the optimization state at iterations 1, 2, and 10.

```{r cosine_examplerun, results="hide"}
run = exampleRun(obj.fun, learner = surr.km, control = control, show.info = FALSE)
```

```{r cosine_plot_examplerun, warning=FALSE}
print(run)
plotExampleRun(run, iters = c(1L, 2L, 10L), pause = FALSE)
```
